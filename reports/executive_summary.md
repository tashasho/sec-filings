## I. Market Evolution: 2008–2025

### Growth Trajectory

The U.S. exempt offering market, as measured by Form D filings, has undergone transformative growth over the past 18 years:

| Period | Avg. Annual Filings | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **2008** | 442 | Initial data (partial year, Form D electronic filing launch) |
| **2009–2012** | 28,118 | Early growth as electronic filing became standard |
| **2013–2015** | 37,111 | Post-JOBS Act acceleration (+32% jump in 2013-2014) |
| **2016–2019** | 43,054 | Steady-state growth (~3-6% YoY) |
| **2020** | 46,089 | COVID disruption: Q2 dip (-20%) followed by rapid Q3-Q4 rebound |
| **2021–2022** | 62,934 | Post-COVID boom: 2022Q1 peak at 18,558 filings/quarter |
| **2023–2025** | 54,464 | Market normalization with rate environment adjustment |

#### Key Structural Shifts
- **JOBS Act Impact (2013-2014)**: The introduction of Rule 506(c) general solicitation led to a 10.5% annual filing jump. By 2014, 89.5% of filings used 506(b) and 6.0% used 506(c).
- **Regulation A+ (2015)**: Stabilized growth at ~2-3% annually as some issuers shifted to Reg A+.
- **SPAC/Venture Boom (2021-2022)**: Record filing volumes driven by SPAC activity, crypto/DeFi issuers, and historically low interest rates. Q1 seasonality peaked at 18,558 filings.
- **Rate Normalization (2023-2025)**: Filing volumes settled ~13% below 2022 peak but 19% above pre-COVID levels, indicating a permanently elevated baseline.

### Capital Markets Activity

Total capital reported as sold across all filings exceeded **$82 trillion** over the study period, with median offering sizes rising from $2.5M (2014 trough) to $3.5M (2019 peak).

| Year | Capital Sold | Median Offering Size |
|---|---|---|
| 2009 | $1,984B | $3.0M |

| Northeast (NY, MA, CT, NJ, PA) | 203,540 | 27.9% |
| West Coast (CA, WA, OR) | 150,719 | 20.6% |
| International | 119,982 | 16.4% |

## IV. Regulatory Landscape

### Exemption Usage (Post-2014)

| Exemption | Share | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 506(b) | ~91% | Dominant, stable since 2014 |
| Rule 506(c) | ~7% | Gradual increase from 6% (2014) to 7.2% (2019) |
| Other/Pre-JOBS Act | ~2% | Legacy filings |

**Key Finding**: Despite enabling general solicitation, Rule 506(c) adoption has been modest (7%). Most issuers continue to prefer 506(b), likely due to the additional compliance burden of verifying accredited investor status required under 506(c).

- **V-shaped recovery**: Q4 2020 already exceeded Q4 2019 by 12.3%
- **Boom phase**: 2021-2022 saw 36% growth over 2019 levels, driven by monetary stimulus and SPAC activity

## VII. Key Takeaways for Fund Managers

1. **Market Maturity**: The private exempt offering market has grown 3x since 2010 (from ~30K to ~55K annual filings), representing a permanently enlarged market with structural depth.

2. **Biotech Dominance in Operating Cos**: Biotech/Pharma represent 5.7% of operating company filings but an outsized share of VC-scale deals ($5-50M), making them the most target-rich sector for growth equity.

3. **Geographic Diversification**: While NY/CA remain dominant, secondary markets (Austin, Denver, Miami, Seattle) are growing faster and may offer less competitive deal sourcing.

4. **506(c) Opportunity**: With only 7% adoption, the general solicitation pathway remains underutilized. Funds that can leverage public marketing while managing the verification burden may find less competition.

5. **COVID Resilience**: Private markets proved remarkably resilient during COVID, with a shallow dip and rapid recovery, suggesting private offerings serve as a stable capital formation channel even during systemic stress.

6. **Filing Seasonality**: Q1 consistently shows 15-20% higher filing volumes than Q3, suggesting optimal deployment timing aligns with Q1/Q4 filing cycles.
